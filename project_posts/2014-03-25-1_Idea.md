## The kit
The “Kit de Libertad de Expresión / Freedom of Speech Kit” consist of an electronic portable banner where a user can display messages either using a local physical interface, such a keyboard, or a virtual one using social networks through internet. Likewise, there is a sort of online platform that allows writing messages and being sent and displayed on the banner.

Different entry interfaces are provided: a physical one, so anyone close to the banner can write and display messages to it, and another one via internet, thus anyone in the world, using their cell phone, computer or other device connected to the internet can send messages to the banner as well.

The device is built with a series of textiles (both conductors and insulators of electricity) and LEDs, together with a microprocessor and communication modules. All software and hardware design have been documented, so anyone would be able to build their own kit (DIY).

## Context
The idea was born during one of many social demonstrations that happened the past years in Spain. We were bringing our hand written banners, once there we all got inspired and have new ideas for messages to display. There is a lot of creativity in the banners messages:

Then a simple idea started growing: promote accessibility and communication between cultures in collective manners; promote freedom of speech! 

Main social movements had been sprouting through social networks, where one connects as individual to, later on, collectively gather on the public space. Hence the idea was to explore tools for providing a smoother transition between the individual use of social networks and the collective expression that public space represents.

We would like to create a platform that provides accessibility to those who for any reason can not be on the street (physical challenge, illness, job restrictions, fear, etc) but want to join the community and share their opinions and ideas by sending a message through it.

So far, Facebook or Twitter or social networks do not solve that. It is a paradox, because even though they are social, their users produce and consume content on them individually. They are collective channels, but their access devices are individual.

The “Kit de Libertad de Expresión” it’s platform producing and displaying content in a collective environment, that could as well be supported by these communication channels. We would like to explore two features that social networks still have not solved: the actual collectivity (in a shared place and time) and its interaction with the public space.
