## Description
The "Kit de Libertad de Expresión  / Freedom of Speech Kit" is  an interactive and portable banner where people can send messages in real time to express their claims during a social demonstration.
Lately, many collective demonstrations have been organized through social networks where people interact individually (from their computers, mobile phones,...) in the pursue of a common goal . The "Kit de Libertad de Expresión" it's a social placard which reduces the gap between the use of social networks for citizens organization and the collective expression of ideas in a demonstration.
